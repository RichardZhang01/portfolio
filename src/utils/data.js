export const about = 'I am an aspiring full-stack developer. I have been coding for a few months and I have loved every second of it. My educational background is in forensic science and nursing, an odd mix of disciplines for sure. But that makes me extremely adaptable, adept at working in teams and communication, and most importantly, I have learned how to learn. I recently earned a full-stack development certificate from University of Toronto\'s coding bootcamp, and I will continue to build on the skills I have developed to improve my abilities and pursue my passion for programming!'
