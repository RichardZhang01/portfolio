# Richard Zhang's React Portfolio

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) 

## Description

-  This is my portfolio page created using React. This is a front-end only application that contains information about me, some of my projects, and some of my links. This application is written to be largely reuseable, and most of the information displayed on the page can be easily changed by editing the data.js file in the src/utils folder. So if anyone would like to use this page as a template, feel free. **You can access the portfolio [here](https://richardzhang01.github.io/portfolio/).**

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

To install this portfolio, you can clone this repo. 

If performing a manual installation, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To install dependencies, open in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and in the terminal run: 

      npm install 

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

Once the application is installed and opened in Visual Studio Code, or navigated to using Git Bash (or similar command-line tool), run: 

      npm run start 

The application runs locally on port 3000.

Once the server has been started, in your browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000

Most of the data on the page can be edited in the `data.js` file in the `src/utils` directory. However, there are some parts of the portfolio that is hardcoded, so keep that in mind if you're planning on using this portfolio as a template.
